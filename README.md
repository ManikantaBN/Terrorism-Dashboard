# Terrorism-Dashboard
The Terrorism Database contains information about terrorist attacks worldwide. It includes details such as the date, location, attack type, weapons used, number of casualties, and responsible groups. Your task is to create a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of global terrorism trends and patterns.
- # **Data Preparation:**
  - Imported data from the source into Power BI.
  - Cleaned data by removing unwanted columns and addressing null values.
  - Renamed columns for improved user-friendliness.
  - Checked and aligned data types with their respective types.

- # **Data Visualization:**
  - Illustrated trends of terrorist attacks over the years.
  - Utilized a map to visualize attack locations, with bubble size indicating a higher success rate for a larger number of attacks.
  - Identified explosives as the most successful attack type.
  - Highlighted private civilians as the most targeted group over government authorities.
  - Observed an increasing trend in both attacks and casualties since 2011.

- # **Interactive Dashboard:**
  - Developed a highly interactive dashboard featuring slicers, filters, and drill-through options.
  - Enabled users to dynamically explore data and gain insights through interactive functionalities.

- # **Insights from Analysis:**
  - Middle East, particularly Iraq, identified as the most affected region.
  - South Asia, including Pakistan and India, also prominently impacted.
  - Taliban emerged as one of the most deadly groups.
  - Explosives noted as the most successfully used mode of attack.
  - Higher success rate observed for attacks on civilians and private property compared to government authorities.
  - Gradual decline in attack frequencies since 2014 following an increase post-2011.

  - **Total Terrorist Attacks:**
    - Summed up the total number of terrorist attacks globally.

  - **Most Used Weapon:**
    - Identified the weapon type most frequently used in attacks.

  - **Most Deadly Group:**
    - Highlighted the terrorist group responsible for the highest number of casualties.

  - **Maximum Attacks in a Year:**
    - Identified the year with the maximum recorded terrorist attacks.

- # **Success Rate Analysis:**

  - **By Group Name:**
    - Calculated the success rate of attacks for each terrorist group.

  - **By Target Type:**
    - Analyzed the success rate based on the type of target, distinguishing between civilians, government authorities, and private property.

  - **By Location and Region:**
    - Evaluated the success rate of attacks considering the geographical location and region.

  - **By Weapon Type:**
    - Assessed the success rate associated with different weapon types.

  - **Casualties and Wounded:**
    - Examined the success rate concerning the number of casualties and wounded.

  - **By Attack Type:**
    - Investigated the success rate for various types of attacks, such as bombings, hijackings, and shootings.

  - **By Year:**
    - Explored the success rate trends over the years, providing insights into the changing dynamics.

These KPIs and success rate analyses offer a comprehensive understanding of the global terrorism trends, shedding light on key aspects such as the magnitude of attacks, preferred tactics, and the impact of different groups in various regions.
